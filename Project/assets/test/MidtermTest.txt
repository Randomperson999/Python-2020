Classes:/|---------------------------|
1. How would you initialize a class called Ree?
class Ree:
class Ree():
def class Ree:
class = Ree
1
You define a class by typing class and then the class name with a colon at the end.

Objects:/|---------------------------|
3. When designing an object, what concept covers the values stored in variables that belong to an object?
Data or Properties
Orientation
Relationships
Behavior
1
The concept is data or properties.
Relationships:/|---------------------------|
4. Which of the following is NOT a general type of relationship between objects?
"Uses-A"
"Has-A"
"Is-A"
"Adds-A"
4
All of them are relationship besides "Adds-A".
Class Functions:/|---------------------------|
5. When a function is defined within a class, it is also called a(n) ___________.
object
variable
method
value
3
A function defined in a class is called a method.
Classes:/|---------------------------|
6. Data that is stored in variables belonging to a class is often called a _______________.
method
property or attribute
list
name
2
The data in variables is a property or attribte.
Classes:/|---------------------------|
7. The data is called a property or attribute./Given the code below, which answer best describes what has been defined?//class Airplane:/   wings = 2/   seats = 40
An object named "airplane" that has two class properties
An object named "airplane" that has two methods
A method named "airplane" that has two child objects
A property named "airplane" that has two local methods
1
Variables at class level are called class properties.
Classes:/|---------------------------|
8. Given the following class definition, which of the answers correctly prints the value stored in the "hour" class variable?//class Clock:/   hour = 10/   minute = 35
print("The hour is:", Clock.hour)
print("The hour is:", hour)
print("The hour is:", Clock)
print("The hour is:", hour.Clock)
1
It would be the class name dot the class variable (Clock.hour)
Classes:/|---------------------------|
9. Given the following code, how and where would you define a method belonging to this object?//class Clock:/   hour = 10/   minute = 35
With a "method" statement located above the "class" statement and indented to the right
With a "def" statement, indented to the right underneath the "class" statement
With a "function" statement located above the "class" statement
With a "def" statement below the "class" statement, aligned on the left with no indentation/*/
2
You would use 'def' and the method name inside a class.
Scope:/|---------------------------|
10. If a variable is declared at a local scope within a function, can it be changed outside of it?
Yes, it can be changed if it’s declared anywhere!
Yes, but only if you do the function name with a dot and the variable name.
No, you can not change it outside of the function because it’s a local variable.
None of these answers are correct.
3
You have to declare a variable at a global or class scope to edit its value.
Class variables:/|---------------------------|
11. Assuming a variable named name is declared at a class scope in a class called name_stuff,/how do you access it within a function defined in name_stuff?
You can simply use it anywhere in the class just by the variable name.
name_stuff.name
name_stuff.name()
name.name_stuff
2
You use the class name with a dot and then the variable name to access a class variable.
String formatting:/|---------------------------|
12. What correctly uses string formatting?
string.format("{}","e")
format.string("{}","e")
string_format("{}","e")
str.format("{}","e")
4
Use str.format() to format a string of text.
String formatting:/|---------------------------|
13. What will the output look like when the code is run?//print(str.format("{1}, {0} {2}", "word", "stuff", "nonesense"))/
word, stuff nonesense
word, nonesense stuff
stuff, word nonesense
It will have an error.
3
0 is the first value,and it counts up from there.
String formatting:/|---------------------------|
14. What does '\t' do?
It tabs the text to the right.
It adds a space.
It changes the font.
It makes a new line.
1
'\t' tabs the text to the right.
String formatting:/|---------------------------|
15. What does '\n' do?
It adds a space.
'\n' is not a string format.
It makes a new line.
It adds an n.
3
'\n' makes a new line.
Vaiables:/|---------------------------|
16. How do you initialize a variable name with "[name]" in it?
name: "[name]"
name = "[name]"
def name = "[name]"
var name = "[name]"
2
You initialize a variable by the name, an equals sign, and then the data inside it./Example: name = "[name]"
Functions:/|---------------------------|/*/
17. Which of the following best describes a "function" in your code?
A special variable that can hold multiple values
A document describing all of the things your program can do
A block of re-usable code that can be used many times from different places in your program
A block of code that will loop while a logical expression is true
3
A function is a block of reusable code that can be used in many places in your program.
Functions:/|---------------------------|
18. Which keyword is always used to start a function definition?
def
function
define
start
1
'def' is used to start a function definition.
Functions:/|---------------------------|
19. What keyword is used to halt a function and go back to the calling code?
end
stop
quit
return
4
The keyword 'return' is used to halt a function.
Functions:/|---------------------------|
20. Given the following function definition://def sound_horn()://    print("Beep, Beep!")//How would you call this function in your code?
call horn
sound_horn()
def sound_horn()
call sound_horn()
2
You just use the function name and opening and closing parenthisis.
Functions:/|---------------------------|
21. Which of the following function names is INVALID?
away_we_go123
AwayWeGo123
123_away_we_go
away1we2go3
3
You can't use numbers in a function or variable name.
Functions:/|---------------------------|
22. Given the function definition below, which of the following statements correctly calls the function?//def square_area ( length, width ):/   area = length * width/   print(area)
square_area(20)
square_area(4,5)
square_area(5, 4, 3)
square_area()
2
There are two values to put into the function.
Functions:/|---------------------------|
23. Which of the following best describes a function parameter?
A constant value that never changes at any point within your program
A variable that can be accessed both inside a function and by external code
A limitation on the number of statements contained inside the function
Something that can be used as a variable inside a function, with an initial value set by the calling code/*/
4
A function parameter is a value that canbe used as a variable inside a method.
